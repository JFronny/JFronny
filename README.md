### Hi there
This account is only used to contribute to projects and is **not where I actually do my development**.

If you wish to contact me about a project I am working on, you can view my **contact information** [here](https://jfronny.gitlab.io/contact.html).

You can view a list of my projects on my [Gitea instance](https://git.frohnmeyer-wds.de/explore/repos) and contribute to them either [here](https://gitlab.com/users/JFronny/projects) or [here](https://gitlab.com/jfmods) (depending on what the project is).
